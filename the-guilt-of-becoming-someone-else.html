<article>
    <p class="reveal">When I first travelled to a new country away from home, arriving there felt like a movie playing in front of my eyes out of sync. The minute I got out of the plane the airport was loud, I was more curious to look around and saw people move with great confidence as they already knew the rules of the world that I just entered. I walked out being cautious, followed the street signs, copied gestures, took a taxi and smiled when others smiled. I was doing fine on the surface but deep inside something felt different and slow as if my mind was still catching up with my body, a state of discomfort and a real happiness alongside that I am exploring a new part of the world.</p>

    <p class="reveal">In the beginning, It was exciting. New streets, New food, New ways of living, a real exploration insight kept me alert all the time, until the day something changed eventually.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Returning back home I began to notice a change in myself . I started to see that I was
thinking differently. Now I noticed I spoke less and listened more. I chose words
carefully and learned when to be direct and when not to be. That's when the guilt
started."
    </blockquote>
     <p class="reveal">I started questioning my behavior, It wasn't a guilt about leaving home, It was a guilt about changing. About realizing that some habits, jokes and parts of me which once felt natural no longer fit. I wasn't the same person but I wasn't losing myself either.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">What Was Changing</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Friends back home said I sound different as if I am a complete new person . People here in the new place still noticed me as a person coming from another part of the world and they can see my accent, my pauses and my hesitations. So I felt stuck in between no longer seeing myself as one thing, not yet another.</p>

    <p class="reveal">I started looking into it and learned Psycology has a name for this process called <strong>cross cultural transition.</strong> Research on cross cultural transition shows that when people move across cultures, identity does not stay stable, instead it shifts as a part of adaptation, people start to learn new social values, rules and change in the ways of their communication and how they relate to others (Berry, 1997). Later studies on cultural shock by (Ward et al., 2001). Shows something deeper, Even after people adapt on the outside, Many tend to feel unsettled from inside.</p>
    <p class="reveal">This inner tension is not a sign of failure but a natural part of psychological adjustment to change.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">Why the Brain Feels Uncomfortable</h2>
    <p class="reveal">The neuroscience point of view explains why this process feels so strange.
        <br><br>
    The Brain is built in a way where it uses past experiences to guess what will happen next. For example we predict and see how people might respond, What kind of behaviour is appropriate in a given situation. When we move into a new cultural environment those predictions stop working.
        <br><br>
Suddenly small things require our attention and effort such as our tone timing of interfering into a conversation, eye contact as our brain is looking at a new environment. It stays in heightened state of attention because it releases can't rely on old patterns.
        <br><br>
(Friston, 2010) According to the predictive process theories this mismatch between expectations and reality creates discomfornt until our brain forms new mental models. In simple terms our brain is rewriting its understanding of ourselves by understanding the world. Which takes time and during this period people often feel uncomfortable, unsure, lost, and guilty not because something is wrong but because something is constantly changing.</p>
       <h2 class="reveal">Living in Between</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Many people going through cultural transitions describe feeling like they live “in between” places. Theorists such as (Bhabha, 1994) call this a liminal space, a state where old identities no longer fully apply, and new ones are still forming. 
        <br><br>
        Research shows that people who allow themselves to integrate both cultures instead of trying to fully replace one with the other tend to adjust better over time (Berry, 1997). Still, integration is not easy. It often comes with mixed emotions, growth alongside loss, freedom alongside guilt.
        <br><br>
        I eventually realized that the guilt I felt was not about betrayal or not that I wasn't interested in my old self or I love my new self or vice versa . But It was about transformation.</p>
    <h2 class="reveal">Conclusion</h2>
    <blockquote><p class="reveal">Becoming someone else does not mean erasing who you were. This experience is common, studied, and deeply human. Yet it is rarely spoken about outside academic papers or private conversations. So if you think you experienced this then we are not broken for feeling this way, we are adapting.</p></blockquote>
