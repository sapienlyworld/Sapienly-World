    <p class="reveal">What happens to our memories when our mother tongue starts to fade?
        <br><br>
        The first time I noticed it I felt almost embarrassed. While I was trying to explain a memory of something I had experienced and lived a thousand times in my own language. The words paused and didn't come out. I switched to another language and I noticed the sentence flowed.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "That was the moment I realized something was not settling. I saw a friction in my mother tongue and I saw I was losing the fluency."
    </blockquote>
     <p class="reveal">Not completely nor dramatically but just enough that I can sense a gap.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">When Words Stop Coming Home</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Friends back home said I sound different as if I am a complete new person . People here in the new place still noticed me as a person coming from another part of the world and they can see my accent, my pauses and my hesitations. So I felt stuck in between no longer seeing myself as one thing, not yet another.</p>

    <p class="reveal">In the beginning I blamed distance, time for the gap. After all, I hadn't lived in that language for years. But it wasn't just a loss of grammar or vocabulary.
        <br><br>
        Certain talks felt harder to access and communicate, Some gave a sense only unless I started switching languages. Certain jokes didn't land in my head the way they used to. It was not that I forgot my past, it was that the way to it had narrowed down.
        <br><br>
        Many people who live across cultures report this experience, yet it rarely gets discussed openly. Losing fluency in your first language can feel like losing a piece of yourself quietly, without permission.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">Language Is Not Just Communication</h2>
    <blockquote>I once wanted to tell a friend how it feels after all this years , while i couldn't express i switched the language and i had a say which felt more meaningful. Language is not a medium of knowledge its just a means of communication if you can see others are understanding the message then its all forgiven there is nothing to feel embarrassed about.</blockquote>
        <p class="reveal">
        Psychology has long shown that language is deeply tied to memory.
        <br><br>
        Research on autobiographical memory suggests that memories are often encoded in the language in which they were originally experienced. This means that recalling a memory can be easier when using the same language in which it was formed (Marian & Neisser, 2000).
        <br><br>
        In simple language it acts like a key and when the key changes access becomes harder. This phenomenon is known as <strong>language dependent memory.</strong> Studies (Schrauf & Rubin, 2000). Shows that memories from childhood are more easily recalled in the mother tongue while later memories are more accessible in the language used at that time.</p>
       <h2 class="reveal">What the Brain Is Doing</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Use it or lose efficieny, The brain prioritizes what it uses most, The more you train the more efficient you become as it strengthens neural pathways that are used often and weakens those that are not.
        <br><br>
        From a neuroscience perspective, this makes sense. Language networks in the brain are closely connected to regions involved in emotion and memory, such as the hippocampus and amygdala. So when a language is used less it weakens the neural pathways connecting their emotions and memory and makes it less efficient. Neuroplasticity (The brain’s ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections in response to learning or experience (Kolb & Whishaw, 1998). It allows us to learn new languages and adapt to new environments
        <br><br>
        But it also means the older pathways are reallocated but not lost, showing that early learned languages remain neurologically stable even when fluency declines.(Pallier et al., 2003).
        <br><br>
        This explains why a song, a smell, or a single word can suddenly unlock an entire emotional world in a language you thought you had lost.</p>
    <h2 class="reveal">The Emotional Weight of Forgetting</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Losing fluency in your first language can feel like losing the connection from your younger self. Conversations with family and firends feel slightly misaligned. Emotions are now felt harder to translate. You may find yourself thinking in one language and feeling it in another.
        <br><br>
        From Neuroscience and psychology lenses it can be understood as it isn't an identity loss but it is layering the old self. Research on bilingual identity suggests that different languages can activate different aspects of the self, including values, emotional tone, and ways of relating to others (Pavlenko, 2005).</p>
     <h2 class="reveal">Not Gone Just Stored Differently</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Over time, I learned that my first language hadn't gone.
        <br><br>
        It's still there in dreams, in moments of strong emotions, in reflexes, Losing fluency is not a failure or an embarassment . It is evidence that your life has expanded across contexts and cultures.</p>
    <h2 class="reveal">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="reveal">This experience is common among migrants, people who have lived and learned multiple languages , and anyone who has lived between worlds. Yet it often carries unnecessary shame and an embarrasment that forgetting words means forgetting roots NO , It doesn’t.</p>
        <blockquote>Neuroscience and psychology show us that this process is normal, adaptive, and reversible in fragments. And your past is not lost, it is stored differently now.</blockquote>
